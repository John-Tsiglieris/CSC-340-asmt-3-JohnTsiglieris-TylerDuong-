### TODO:

- Fix compilation errors
- Find out appendK needs to be used
- All data fields in amazon340 should be moved to Vendor
- displayProfile and modifyPassword should be part of Vendor.
- Amazon <-> Vendor multiplicity? (I don't remember what multiplicity means -John)
- sell() is common, it should be moved to Product + other functions in Product.
